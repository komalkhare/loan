# Deploy-Loan-Approval-Classifier-on-Azure-cloud

In this project, I'll walk you through deploying any Machine Learning project, Loan Approval Classifier model in our case, on Azure Cloud.

## **Directory Structure**
 * Data: Data used for this project. However Train/DataPrep.py will be used to import real time data from Database for our this project.
 * configs: It contains the configuration files that will be utilized to store different credential data such DB related credentials, etc.
	* configs/config.yaml: Stores DB server's credentials.
 	* configs/env.yml : Dependencies that need to be installed for this project.
 * Train: It contains python scripts that will be utilized for Model training.
 	* Train/DataPrep.py : Import Data from DB and preprocess it.
  	* Train/model.py :  Python script for model training and export pickle file to outputs directory.

* outputs : Stores various output and pickle files such as Encode,pre-processor used in training step, Trained Model,etc.

* Prediction: It contains python scripts that will be utilized to predit test, or actual data.
	* prepare.py: Preprocess and predict response variable for test data
 	* score.py: Azure script file.
* Performance: It contains python scripts that will be utilized to assess model performance on actual data and performance across different run_Ids over the time.
	* FindActuals.py: Calculate model performance and store logs in Database.
 	* Performance/modelPerformance.py: Calculate model performance over the time across different run_Ids to check model or data drift.

* utils.py: It contains different utility functions.
* main.py: Python script to define order to follow to execute different relavant Azure experiment scripts.
* requirements.txt: Python dependencies that will be required to be installed to run this project.
